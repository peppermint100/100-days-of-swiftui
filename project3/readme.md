# Challenge
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible,
so here are three ways you should try extending this app to make sure you fully understand whatâ€™s going on:

1. Go back to project 1 and use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip.

2. Go back to project 2 and replace the Image view used for flags with a new FlagImage()
view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had.

3. Create a custom ViewModifier (and accompanying View extension) that makes a
view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view.

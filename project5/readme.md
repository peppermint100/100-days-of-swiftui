# Challenge
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try extending this app to make sure you fully understand what’s going on:

1. Disallow answers that are shorter than three letters or are just our start word.
2. Add a toolbar button that calls startGame(), so users can restart with a new word whenever they want to.
3. Put a text view somewhere so you can track and show the player’s score for a given root word. How you calculate score is down to you, but something involving number of words and their letter count would be reasonable.
